1. Why is the order of print statements in the output inconsistent across multiple runs?
    parent
    child

2. Introduce a 1 second delay by calling the sleep() function before the print statement in parent. Recompile and run. What is the the difference in ordering of statements now and the before?
    parent
    child

3. Add a line to the parent code that prints the process id (pid) of the child. Also, add a line to the child that calls getpid() and then prints the process id that is returned. Compile and run your modified program. What are the two values?
    In parent
    pid of parent: 72311
    In child
    pid of child: 72312

4. Now, print the parent’s process id in both child and parent. You can obtain it by calling function getppid(). What are the two values?
    In parent
    pid of parent: 72664
    pid of parent's child: 72665
    In child
    pid of child: 72665
    pid of parent: 72664

5. Add a line to print the value of x in the child after it has been incremented. Add a line to print the value of x in the parent after it has been decremented. Recompile the program and rerun it. Why isn’t the last value printed 1?
    In parent
    pid of parent: 72710
    pid of parent's child: 72711
    x: 0
    In child
    pid of child: 72711
    pid of parent: 72710
    x: 2

1. What is the total number of times each of the lines is printed? Why?
line1
line2
line1
Line4
line2
line2
line3
line2
Line4
line3
line3
Line4
Line4
line3

2. Modify the program to print the pids and parent pids. (e.g., printf("%d: %d: Line 1\n", getpid(), getppid());)). Capture the output in lab11.txt. Why is the parent pid 1 for some processes?
line1
pid: 73006 ppid: 71019
line2
pid: 73006 ppid: 71019
line1
pid: 73007 ppid: 73006
Line4
pid: 73006 ppid: 71019
line2
pid: 73008 ppid: 73006
line2
pid: 73007 ppid: 1
line3
pid: 73009 ppid: 1
line2
Line4
pid: 73010 ppid: 73007
pid: 73007 ppid: 1
Line4
pid: 73008 ppid: 1
line3
pid: 73011 ppid: 1
line3
pid: 73012 ppid: 1
Line4
line3
pid: 73010 ppid: 1
pid: 73013 ppid: 73010
